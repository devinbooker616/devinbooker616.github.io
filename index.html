          Hello there. I am from Water Valley, MS. I currently attend Base Camp
          Coding Academy and am learning how to be an efficient, competitive,
          and well-learned software engineer. It has always been a dream of mine
          to work in the software industry, and I have been working toward that
          dream since the start of my high school career.

                teaches high school graduates to be full-stack web developers. I

                general well-intentioned volunteer work for the state called
                Lion's club. This helped me learn more in-depth knowledge of
